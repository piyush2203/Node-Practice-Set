Why Do We Need Content-Type?
The browser doesn’t know how to display the response unless we tell it.

Example:

text/html → Show as a webpage

application/json → Treat as JSON

text/plain → Just plain text



Common Content-Types You Should Know
✔ text/html → For HTML pages
✔ application/json → For APIs returning JSON
✔ text/plain → For plain text
✔ image/png or image/jpeg → For images
✔ application/pdf → For PDF files
